/**
 * Action context resolver
 *
 * Returns the equipment and active drinks to use when predicting an action's
 * outcome (XP, time, profit, materials). When the loadoutSnapshot feature is
 * enabled and a saved loadout matches the action type, that snapshot is used
 * — so predictions reflect the gear the user would auto-equip rather than
 * whatever happens to be on their character right now.
 *
 * Resolution priority (handled inside loadoutSnapshot._findSnapshot):
 *   1. Skill-specific default loadout
 *   2. All-skills default loadout
 *   3. Skill-specific non-default
 *   4. All-skills non-default
 *   5. Fall back to currently-equipped gear / current drinks
 *
 * Equipment and drinks are resolved independently — it's valid to inherit the
 * snapshot's equipment while no snapshot drinks exist, in which case the
 * current drinks are used (and vice-versa).
